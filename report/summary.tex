\subsection{Problems}

The first problem we ran into was that a capacitor in the Osborne 1
exploded when it was first plugged in---the capacitor had absorbed
moisture over the years and this caused it to heat up and
explode---but this was easily fixed by replacing the capacitor with a
modern one.

The first board we had made turned out to be too big, and collided with
the power connector on the Osborne's logic board, so we had to design a second
version, for which we used more SMD components, enabling us to shrink
it to less than half the size.

Once we managed to get the RP2040 to run using the clock provided by
the Osborne 1, the increased power draw caused the tiny common-mode
choke in our power supply to saturate, causing excessive power draw
and insufficient voltage. To fix this we replaced it with a hand-wound
inductor we made earlier.
